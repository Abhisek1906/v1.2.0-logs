Niacinamide has a vital role in growing long and strong hair due to its circulation boosting properties. It enhances the appearance and feel of hair, by increasing body, suppleness, sheen. It also improves the texture of hair that has been physically/chemically damaged by helping to build Keratin. It also enhances the appearance of dry or damaged skin on the scalp by reducing flaking and restoring suppleness. Ginseng Extract is believed to increase the dermal cells on the scalp which, in turn, strengthens the follicles and roots of the hair. This not only encourages the new growth of strands but also prevents hair thinning and breakage.",

Hyaluronic Acid is an excellent humectant and moisturiser that has the ability to retain significant amounts of moisture in the skin, thereby creating a plumping effect.  Jojoba Oil is a non-comedogenic oil derived from seed of the Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) plant, and is rich in Vitamin E. It keeps lips moisturised and nourished, thus preventing hyperpigmentation by keeping them healthy. Lips tend to dry up more rapidly because they lack the protective film that the rest of the skin has, due to the lack of sweat from glands and oil generated by follicles. Jojoba oil is the ideal lip care product because it hydrates them, shields them from sunburn, and makes them appear plumper and fuller.  Niacinamide is a water-soluble form of Vitamin B3 that strengthens the skins barrier and boosts the skins mechanism of healing, thus ideal for sensitive, dry and cracked lips.  Lotus Extract is rich in vitamins B and C, iron and protein, all of which are extremely beneficial in making the skin look fresh and clean. It also helps retain the natural hydration of lips.",

Hyaluronic Acid helps reduce the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles retaining moisture to the skin, creating a plumping effect. When the skin is protected and hydrated, increased skin cell production can take place, as the skin isn't busy fighting for hydration. This leads to smoother, plumper skin cells.",

Hyaluronic Acid is an excellent humectant and moisturiser that has the ability to retain significant amounts of moisture in the skin, thereby creating a plumping effect.  Jojoba Oil is a non-comedogenic oil derived from seed of the Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) plant, and is rich in Vitamin E. It keeps lips moisturised and nourished, thus preventing hyperpigmentation by keeping them healthy. Lips tend to dry up more rapidly because they lack the protective film that the rest of the skin has, due to the lack of sweat from glands and oil generated by follicles. Jojoba oil is the ideal lip care product because it hydrates them, shields them from sunburn, and makes them appear plumper and fuller.  Niacinamide is a water-soluble form of Vitamin B3 that strengthens the skins barrier and boosts the skins mechanism of healing, thus ideal for sensitive, dry and cracked lips.  Lotus Extract is rich in vitamins B and C, iron and protein, all of which are extremely beneficial in making the skin look fresh and clean. It also helps retain the natural hydration of lips.",

Amla is one of the best natural ingredient that help prevent hair fall and premature greying. Considered as a superfood for hair, Amla is rich in vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and phytonutrients that increase the circulation of blood significantly throughout the scalp. Curry leaves are rich in antioxidants. These antioxidants moisturise the scalp, and also remove dead hair follicles. Apart from that, curry leaves are high in beta-carotene and protein content, which are instrumental in preventing hair loss and thinning of hair. Proteins are also essential for hair growth since hair is made of protein. Curry leaves are also high in amino acid content which strengthen the hair fibre.",

Hyaluronic Acid is an excellent humectant and moisturiser that has the ability to retain significant amounts of moisture in the skin, thereby creating a plumping effect.  Jojoba Oil is a non-comedogenic oil derived from seed of the Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) plant, and is rich in Vitamin E. It keeps lips moisturised and nourished, thus preventing hyperpigmentation by keeping them healthy. Lips tend to dry up more rapidly because they lack the protective film that the rest of the skin has, due to the lack of sweat from glands and oil generated by follicles. Jojoba oil is the ideal lip care product because it hydrates them, shields them from sunburn, and makes them appear plumper and fuller.  Niacinamide is a water-soluble form of Vitamin B3 that strengthens the skins barrier and boosts the skins mechanism of healing, thus ideal for sensitive, dry and cracked lips.  Lotus Extract is rich in vitamins B and C, iron and protein, all of which are extremely beneficial in making the skin look fresh and clean. It also helps retain the natural hydration of lips.",

It also improves the texture of hair that has been physically/chemically damaged by helping to build Keratin. It also enhances the appearance of dry or damaged skin on the scalp by reducing flaking and restoring suppleness.

Jojoba Oil is a non-comedogenic oil derived from seed of the Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) plant, and is rich in Vitamin E. It keeps lips moisturised and nourished, thus preventing hyperpigmentation by keeping them healthy. Lips tend to dry up more rapidly because they lack the protective film that the rest of the skin has, due to the lack of sweat from glands and oil generated by follicles. Jojoba oil is the ideal lip care product because it hydrates them, shields them from sunburn, and makes them appear plumper and fuller.  Niacinamide is a water-soluble form of Vitamin B3 that strengthens the skins barrier and boosts the skins mechanism of healing, thus ideal for sensitive, dry and cracked lips.  Lotus Extract is rich in vitamins B and C, iron and protein, all of which are extremely beneficial in making the skin look fresh and clean. It also helps retain the natural hydration of lips.",

Hyaluronic Acid is an excellent humectant and moisturiser that has the ability to retain significant amounts of moisture in the skin, thereby creating a plumping effect.  Jojoba Oil is a non-comedogenic oil derived from seed of the Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) plant, and is rich in Vitamin E. It keeps lips moisturised and nourished, thus preventing hyperpigmentation by keeping them healthy. Lips tend to dry up more rapidly because they lack the protective film that the rest of the skin has, due to the lack of sweat from glands and oil generated by follicles. Jojoba oil is the ideal lip care product because it hydrates them, shields them from sunburn, and makes them appear plumper and fuller.  Niacinamide is a water-soluble form of Vitamin B3 that strengthens the skins barrier and boosts the skins mechanism of healing, thus ideal for sensitive, dry and cracked lips.  Lotus Extract is rich in vitamins B and C, iron and protein, all of which are extremely beneficial in making the skin look fresh and clean. It also helps retain the natural hydration of lips.",
